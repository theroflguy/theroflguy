I am a data science enthusiast with experience in doing mini projects with the help of Python programming. I am well aware with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. I am currently on a learning path to Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, which I have found myself gravitating to.

Spectrum of skillsets:
1. Data Analysis, provide insights and provide necessary recommendations
2. Data preprocessing and Data Visualization using suitable plots, graphs, and tree diagrams
3. Proficiency in Data mining techniques such as Classifications, Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Association rules, recommendation Systems, and Cluster analysis
4. Proficiency in building ML models (Regression, Logistic Classifier, Decision tree, KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Random forest, Gradient boosting algorithms ).
5. Proficiency in Python Programming for ML Algorithms using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Stats model, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Tensorflow,
6. Time series analysis and building models based on the scenario to forecast the business interests
7. Text mining, Sentiment analysis, and Emotion Mining
8. Knowledge of Deep learning methodologies
9. Good Domain knowledge in the Electronics industry.

Also, I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering.
